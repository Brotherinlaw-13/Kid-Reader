We've created a professional script that integrates with the best AI image services:

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

   - **Replicate** (Midjourney-style): https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
   - **Stability AI**: https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys
   - **Leonardo.AI**: https://leonardo.ai/

3. **Set your API key**:
   ```bash
   # For OpenAI (Recommended - highest quality)
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"
   
   # Or for Replicate (Midjourney-style models)
   export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your-replicate-token-here"
